# LLM.lang Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the LLM.lang programming language.

## Phase 1: Core Language Design and Specification

- [x] Define language philosophy and core principles
- [x] Design basic syntax and semantics
- [x] Specify type system and memory model
- [x] Document LLM-specific language features
- [ ] Finalize standard library specification

## Phase 2: Prototype Implementation

### Lexer and Parser
- [ ] Implement tokenizer for formal syntax
- [ ] Implement tokenizer for natural language syntax
- [ ] Develop parser for generating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- [ ] Create semantic analyzer for contextual understanding

### Core Runtime
- [ ] Implement basic type system
- [ ] Develop memory management system
- [ ] Create execution environment
- [ ] Implement standard library core functions

### LLM-Specific Features
- [ ] Implement contextual awareness mechanisms
- [ ] Develop pattern-based programming constructs
- [ ] Create natural language integration layer
- [ ] Implement parallel thought processes
- [ ] Develop self-modifying capabilities

## Phase 3: Tooling and Infrastructure

- [ ] Develop command-line interpreter/compiler
- [ ] Create language server for IDE integration
- [ ] Implement debugger
- [ ] Develop package manager
- [ ] Create documentation generator

## Phase 4: Standard Library Development

- [ ] Implement text processing and NLP modules
- [ ] Develop pattern matching and transformation utilities
- [ ] Create knowledge representation framework
- [ ] Implement reasoning and inference engines
- [ ] Develop external API integration tools
- [ ] Create data processing and analysis libraries

## Phase 5: Interoperability

- [ ] Implement Python interoperability
- [ ] Develop JavaScript/Web integration
- [ ] Create C/C++ FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- [ ] Implement database connectors
- [ ] Develop API integration tools

## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform performance benchmarking
- [ ] Optimize critical components
- [ ] Conduct security analysis
- [ ] Implement performance profiling tools

## Phase 7: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Complete language reference documentation
- [ ] Create tutorial series
- [ ] Develop example projects
- [ ] Write best practices guide
- [ ] Create cookbook with common patterns

## Phase 8: Community and Ecosystem

- [ ] Launch official website
- [ ] Create community forums
- [ ] Develop contribution guidelines
- [ ] Establish governance model
- [ ] Create educational resources

## Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 months | None |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 months | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 months | Phase 2 (partial) |
| Phase 4 | 3-4 months | Phase 2 |
| Phase 5 | 2-3 months | Phase 2, Phase 4 (partial) |
| Phase 6 | 2-3 months | Phase 2, Phase 4 |
| Phase 7 | 1-2 months | All previous phases |
| Phase 8 | Ongoing | Phase 7 |

## Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 1** of the implementation roadmap, focusing on finalizing the language design and specifications before moving to prototype implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the standard library specification
2. Begin implementation of the lexer and parser
3. Develop initial prototype of the core runtime
4. Create basic examples to validate the language design
