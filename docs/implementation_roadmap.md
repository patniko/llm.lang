# LLM.lang Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the LLM.lang programming language.

## Phase 1: Core Language Design and Specification

- [x] Define language philosophy and core principles
- [x] Design basic syntax and semantics
- [x] Specify type system and memory model
- [x] Document LLM-specific language features
- [ ] Finalize standard library specification

## Phase 2: Prototype Implementation

### Lexer and Parser
- [x] Implement tokenizer for formal syntax
- [x] Implement tokenizer for natural language syntax
- [x] Develop parser for generating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- [x] Create semantic analyzer for contextual understanding

### Core Runtime
- [x] Implement basic type system
- [x] Develop memory management system
- [x] Create execution environment
- [x] Implement standard library core functions

### LLM-Specific Features
- [x] Implement contextual awareness mechanisms
- [x] Develop pattern-based programming constructs
- [x] Create natural language integration layer
- [x] Implement parallel thought processes
- [x] Develop self-modifying capabilities

## Phase 3: Tooling and Infrastructure

- [x] Develop command-line interpreter/compiler
- [x] Create language server for IDE integration
- [x] Implement debugger
- [ ] Develop package manager
- [ ] Create documentation generator

## Phase 4: Standard Library Development

- [ ] Implement text processing and NLP modules
- [ ] Develop pattern matching and transformation utilities
- [ ] Create knowledge representation framework
- [ ] Implement reasoning and inference engines
- [ ] Develop external API integration tools
- [ ] Create data processing and analysis libraries

## Phase 5: Interoperability

- [ ] Implement Python interoperability
- [ ] Develop JavaScript/Web integration
- [ ] Create C/C++ FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- [ ] Implement database connectors
- [ ] Develop API integration tools

## Phase 6: Testing and Optimization

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Perform performance benchmarking
- [ ] Optimize critical components
- [ ] Conduct security analysis
- [ ] Implement performance profiling tools

## Phase 7: Documentation and Examples

- [ ] Complete language reference documentation
- [ ] Create tutorial series
- [ ] Develop example projects
- [ ] Write best practices guide
- [ ] Create cookbook with common patterns

## Phase 8: Community and Ecosystem

- [ ] Launch official website
- [ ] Create community forums
- [ ] Develop contribution guidelines
- [ ] Establish governance model
- [ ] Create educational resources

## Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 2-3 months | None |
| Phase 2 | 4-6 months | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 months | Phase 2 (partial) |
| Phase 4 | 3-4 months | Phase 2 |
| Phase 5 | 2-3 months | Phase 2, Phase 4 (partial) |
| Phase 6 | 2-3 months | Phase 2, Phase 4 |
| Phase 7 | 1-2 months | All previous phases |
| Phase 8 | Ongoing | Phase 7 |

## Current Status

We are currently in **Phase 3** of the implementation roadmap, having completed the prototype implementation (Phase 2) and made significant progress on tooling and infrastructure. We have implemented the command-line interpreter/compiler, language server for IDE integration, and debugger. We are now focusing on developing a package manager and documentation generator.

## Next Steps

1. Develop package manager
2. Create documentation generator
3. Begin work on Phase 4: Standard Library Development
